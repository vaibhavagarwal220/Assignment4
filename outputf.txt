692 : the people permitted to enter.  Hither had come nearly all the people
699 : me by these people was identical.  In all eyes the question was
704 : exist,--a man who pities us?"  This query was on every face.  You

735 : rounds, when, as he had no passport, he would be taken to jail, and
747 : at the peasants' remarks, thinking by this means to adopt the proper
754 : a rope, and in bast shoes, who was drunk.  Then a small man with a
775 : like twenty rubles; and in company with the crowd, I entered the
798 : arguments which people have been devising for so many centuries, in
804 : nonsense; that, no matter how many people might assemble in order to
812 : thousands of such people in Moscow, while I and other thousands dined
818 : a direct accomplice in the matter.  The difference for me between

897 : have called forth my compassion.  The whole point lies here,--that I

911 : for the poverty of the city, to collect money, to get people together
913 : refuges of poverty in company with the census, and, in addition to
917 : their children in school, and the old people in hospitals and
918 : asylums.  And not only that, I thought, but these people who
933 : whom I hoped for sympathy.  I said the same thing to every one whom I
935 : that I afterwards printed in my memoir; proposed to take advantage of

946 : impossible to openly characterize as such.  Some external cause

970 : of them proposed to give me the money on the spot, but they merely
